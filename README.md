## Project Scope & Assumptions
---
Due to the complexity of designing a bus journey planning application, this application is limited to providing bus route planning for the following bus services (as defined in the project specifications provided):
- Loop Services
    - P101 â€“ Larkin Terminal âŠƒ Johor Bahru City
        - Start: Larkin Terminal
        - End: Larkin Terminal
    - P106 â€“ PPR Sri Stulang âŠƒ AEON Tebrau City
        - Start: Hub PPR Sri Stulang
        - End: Hub PPR Sri Stulang
    - P202 â€“ Taman Universiti âŠƒ Taman Ungku Tun Aminah
        - Start: Taman Universiti Terminal
        - End: Taman Universiti Terminal
    - P403 â€“ Econsave Senai âŠƒ Skudai Parade
        - Start: Econsave Senai
        - End: Econsave Senai
- One-Way Services
    - P102 â€“ PPR Sri Stulang â‡” Majlis Bandaraya Johor Bahru
        - P102-01
            - Start: Hub PPR Sri Stulang
            - End: Majlis Bandaraya Johor Bahru
        - P102-02
            - Start: Majlis Bandaraya Johor Bahru
            - End: Hub PPR Sri Stulang
    - P211 â€“ Taman Universiti â‡” Larkin Terminal
        - P211-01
            - Start: Taman Universiti Terminal
            - End: Larkin Terminal
        - P211-02
            - Start: Larkin Terminal
            - End: Taman Universiti Terminal
    - P411 â€“ Kulai â‡” Larkin Terminal
        - P411-01
            - Start: Kulai Terminal
            - End: Larkin Terminal
        - P411-02
            - Start: Larkin Terminal
            - End: Kulai Terminal

The following bus stops were excluded (*instructed to ignore bus stops in the dataset*):
- KFC (Road side)
    - P202
- Tesco Lotus (Road side)
    - P202
- bef Jalan Kempas Lama
    - P211-01
    - P411-01

The following assumptions were also taken to simplify the development of the application:
1. Assume all bus service information (ie coordinates) provided in the `bus_stop.xlsx` dataset are correct (minor corrections were made).
2. Assume all buses will adhere to the specified bus schedule every day of the week, not taking into account any other factors (ie bus breakdowns).
3. Assume all buses will travel at the normal speed of `70km/h`.
4. Assume users will take a bus to travel to their destination, regardless of the distance between their starting point and ending point (ie 10 meter difference only).

## System Design
---
This application consists of the following components:
1. Database (GCP Cloud server)
2. Flask Web Application
3. Telegram Bot
4. API Integrations (Google Map, OSRAM, PAJ, Gmail)

![System Design](/docs/system-design.png)

This application utilises a MySQL database hosted on the cloud through the [Google CloudÂ Platform](https://cloud.google.com/sql). However, the application also supports the use of a local MySQL database, should the cloud server be unavailable. 

The main user interface for this application is deployed using the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) Python web framework. The Flask application is responsible for getting all user inputs, the processing of the path to a given destination, and displaying the results to the user. A chat-based user interface using a [Telegram bot](https://t.me/Johor_Planner_Bot) is also provided.

## Data Structures Used
---
![Data Structures](/docs/data-structure.png)

## Algorithms Used
---
Two different algorithms are used to provide journey planning: 

1. Dijkstra Shortest Path with minimum bus transfer
    - Dijkstraâ€™s seeks the shortest path between start node and next node

2. A Star algorithm with heuristic function
    - A Star seeks the shortest time between start node and end node
    - Performs like Dijkstra but with heuristic function calculating estimated weight to end node
    - Calculated using Haversine distance and must be admissible (NEVER overestimated)

## Features
---
<u>Flask User Interface</u><br>
The main user interface for this application is hosted using the Flask web framework. Flask is used to integrate Python code together with the various web components (HTML, CSS and Javascript). A sample screenshot of the user interface is provided below:
![User Interface](/docs/ui.png)

<u>Telegram Bot User Interface</u><br>
To supplement the main application, a [Telegram bot](https://t.me/Johor_Planner_Bot) was also created for users to perform bus journey planning using a chat-base interface. A sample screenshot of the chat-based interface is provided below:
![Chat Interface](/docs/telebot.png)

<u>Pengangkutan Awam Johor (PAJ) API</u><br>
The API provided by Malaysia's (Johor) public transportation provider, [PAJ](https://dataapi.paj.com.my/) is used during the initial population of data into the database, and the planning of routes (specifically live bus data). Live bus data will be presented in the displayed map, and live bus data can be toggled to be integrated into the route planning with the A Star algorithm.

<u>Google Maps API</u><br>
The [API](https://developers.google.com/maps) provided by Google Maps is used, specifically for the calculation of distances between bus stops, as well as general wayfinding to the starting bus stop and to the destination point during the last mile connectivity. The following API were used:
- Distance Matrix
- Geoencoding
- Reverse Geoencoding
- Directions

<u>Web Crawler</u><br>
To facilitate future route expansion and to automate the getting of bus schedule information, a web crawler was created to programmatically scrape the relevant bus schedule information. The crawler is designed for portability for ease of future expansion.

<u>User Validations</u><br>
Validation of user inputs, such as their given coordinates and text addresses was performed to make the application more robust.

<u>Email</u><br>
Upon completion of the bus journey planning, users can choose to send a copy of the planned journey to themselves via email.

<u>Database</u><br>
A MySQL database was designed to store the bus route information. The database design is provided in the Entity Relationship Diagram below.

## User Flow
---
The following user flow is used for the entire journey planner application:
1. User enter inputs
    - Starting Address 
    - Destination Address
Route option (Shortest or Fastest Path)
2. Validate userâ€™s inputs
    - Convert address to coordinates or vice versa
    - Locate nearest bus stop from start addressÂ and end address
3. Guide user to bus stop, if not already there (walking directions)
    - Guide user to nearest bus stop
4. Determine bus route
    - Run selected path algorithm (Shortest or Fastest Path)
    - Determine bus route from nearest bus stopÂ 
    - Display the bus route and number to take at each bus stop
5. Guide user to endpoint, if not already there (walking directions)
- Guide user to destination

## Project Components
